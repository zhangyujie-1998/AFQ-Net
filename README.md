This respository is about a no-reference point cloud quality metric based on asynchronous learning. The key idea is **using global feature to directly guide the "generation" of local feature**.

## 🎦 Introduction

Recent years have witnessed the success of the deep learning-based technique in research of no-reference point cloud quality assessment (NR-PCQA). For a more accurate quality prediction, many previous studies have attempted to capture global and local features in a bottom-up manner, but ignored the interaction and promotion between them. To solve this problem, we propose a novel asynchronous feedback quality prediction network (AFQ-Net). Motivated by human visual perception mechanisms, AFQ-Net employs a dual-branch structure to deal with global and local features, simulating the left and right hemispheres of the human brain, and constructs a feedback module between them. Specifically, the input point clouds are first fed into a transformer-based global encoder to generate the attention maps that highlight these semantically rich regions, followed by being merged into the global feature. Then, we utilize the generated attention maps to perform dynamic convolution for different semantic regions and obtain the local feature. Finally, a coarse-to-fine strategy is adopted to merge the two features into the final quality score. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three datasets and achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-art approaches on all of these datasets. 

## 🔧 Dependencies

Please use the following commands to install dependencies:

```
conda create --name AFQNet python=3.10
conda activate AFQNet 
conda install pytorch==1.13.0 torchvision==0.14.0 torchaudio==0.13.0 pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Additionally, we need to render point clouds into images by Pytorch3D, please follow the steps to install Pytorch3D.

```
conda install -c bottler nvidiacub
conda install pytorch3d -c pytorch3d
```

## 📦 Data Preparation

We use 2D projections of point clouds as the network input, including texture, depth and occupancy images. You need to run MyProjection.py in the  ```projection``` folder to get projections. *We provide the download links for the projections of the used databases including SJTU-PCQA, WPC, LS-PCQA, BASICS and M-PCCD, which can be accessed here  [Onedrive](https://1drv.ms/f/c/669676c02328fc1b/Eonj9bAnDT5NrXkHMzTKuDABIAz6VdX-dHi8JvfTMi_Tiw?e=mHKXZV)*.

If you want to create projections for new databases, you need to replace the path of  'data_dir' in the MyProjection.py with the path of data on your computer. The file structure of used data should be like:

```

├── SJTU-PCQA

│  ├── hhi_0.ply

│  ├── hhi_1.ply

...

```

## 🚆 Training

AFQ-Net uses pre-trained vision transformer (ViT) as the backbone and we provide the pre-trained weight of ViT in  [Onedrive](https://1drv.ms/f/c/669676c02328fc1b/Eonj9bAnDT5NrXkHMzTKuDABIAz6VdX-dHi8JvfTMi_Tiw?e=mHKXZV).  You need to put the pre-trained weights in the ```checkpoint``` folder. Then, you can simply train the AFQ-Net by referring to train.sh.  You only need to replace the path of 'data_dir_texture', 'data_dir_depth' and 'data_dir_mask' with the path of projections on your computer. If you want to use the databases adopted in the paper, you can unzip the provided .zip file in the  ```database``` folder.
